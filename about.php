The opportunity to experience many unique cultures is priceless. However, what makes these experiences so much more special is that we have been able to share it with the people we travel with and have met along the way. Wherever we go, we always make time to sit down for a cup of tea and recollect the best moments from our journey.</p>
            <p>Kindred Teas is inspired by these precious moments. We believe that tea can foster relationships; bringing you closer to the people you share it with. Our mission is to bring you quality teas from around the world, so that you can create these moments with those that matter most, or simply savour during some quiet time alone.</p>
            <p>We have created a selection of specially crafted teas that we hope you will enjoy just as much as we have enjoyed searching for them.</p>

            <h1>Meet Kindred’s Founder</h1>
            <p><span class="first-letter">M</span>addie lives a life of contradictions. She expounds the importance of health and wellness, while simultaneously baking indulgent treats for loved ones and herself (but mostly herself). She also owns a collection of butterfly accessories, while at the same time suffering from Lepidopterophobia. She chastises people for having one too many cups of coffee daily, but proudly announces that she can’t get by a single day without at least five cups of tea.</p>
            <p>Maddie is an avid tea drinker and is the creator and curator of all of Kindred’s teas. The teas are inspired by her experiences traveling around the world. She loves traveling with her companions rather than alone, because she believes that beautiful memories should be shared (and also because she a needs a photographer).</p>
            <p>When she’s not sipping on a cup of tea, you can find her either honing her baking skills, having practiced at the prestigious Le Cordon Bleu Paris, or at the gym training for her next Muay Thai fight.</p>
