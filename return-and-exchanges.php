            <h1>Return & Exchange Policy</h1>
            <p>Due to the nature of our products, we do not accept returns nor exchanges unless we have sent the wrong order to you or if the items are defective or damaged not due to shipping. Please contact us via email at <a href="mailto:hello@kindredteas.com">hello@kindredteas.com</a> to request for an exchange, stating your reasons for return or exchange, and also your order number.</p>
            <p>Once your request has been approved, we will arrange for our delivery service provider to pick up the order from you. Your order should be returned in its original condition, with the tamper-proof seal still intact.</p>
            <p>Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. It will take 1 to 2 working days for us to send out your order once again. You will receive an email to notify you of your new tracking number for the order. In the case that the item is no longer in stock, store credit or refund will be issued instead.</p>
